I limited this to an hour of my time and created the backend api for and application.
The frontend could be created in React, Node or Vue javascript, which would also
handle the pages, in which i do give and example (rails notes).

I use the JWTSessions gem to handle token authentication, also cors, redis and
bycrpt to csrf.

I handle validations both on the table  (schema) and on the models.
